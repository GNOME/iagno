  <title>What is Iagno?</title>
  
  <para>
  <application>Iagno</application> is a computer version of 
  the game Reversi, more popularly called Othello.  
  <application>Iagno</application> is a two player strategy 
  game similar to Go.  The board is 8 by 8 with tiles that 
  are black on one side and white on the other side.  The 
  object of <application>Iagno</application> is to flip as 
  many of your opponent's tiles to your color as possible 
  without your opponent flipping your tiles.  This is done 
  by trapping your opponent's tiles between two tiles of 
  your own color.
  </para>

  <para>
    &appname; also features <link linkend="network-games">multiplayer</link> support with two 
    human players in hotseat or network mode.
  </para>

   To run <application>Iagno</application>, select
   <guimenuitem>Iagno</guimenuitem> from the
   <guisubmenu>Games</guisubmenu> submenu of the <guimenu>Main
   Menu</guimenu>, or type <command>iagno</command> on the
   command line.

 <sect2 id="why">
  <title>Why is Othello called Iagno?</title>
  <para>
  You're probably wondering why this game is called
  <application>Iagno</application> instead of Othello or
  even gnothello.  The answer is complicated, and involves
  things like trademarks and lawyers and whatnot.
  Instead of leaving 
  it at that, I'll tell you a long and complicated lie about 
  the origin of the name <application>Iagno</application>.
  </para>
  <para>
  On a stormy night, like those depicted so much in England, 
  a lonely programmer was sitting in front of his computer 
  screen.  Ian had finished his masterpiece in gaming.  It 
  was a fully interactive game of Othello and he decided
  to play a pun with the name and called it gnothello for 
  the game was written using GNOME.  
  </para>
  <para>
  Later his buddies came over and like all programmers he 
  showed off his masterpiece.  They all laughed in his face 
  and told Ian that his game was worthless and a pitiful 
  attempt to be a true hacker.  After Ian kicked them out 
  he decided to rename his program Iago 
  <footnote>
   <para>
   Iago is Othello's nemesis in the play <citetitle>Othello
   </citetitle> by William Shakespeare.
   </para>
  </footnote>
  for the evil which 
  had manifested itself due to his game.  Yet it still 
  didn't sound right.  All GNOME programs have some part 
  of GNOME in it, Ian thought.  After much thought he decided 
  on the name we have come to cherish, <application>Iagno
  </application>.
  </para>
 </sect2>

<sect1 id="playing">
 <title>Playing Iagno</title>
 <para>
 The board starts with four tiles arranged in a box on the 
 middle of the board. The tiles have the same color at each 
 corner, as shown in <xref linkend="start-shot"/>. 
 </para>

 <para>
 Black goes first and places a tile on the board such that it 
 traps white's tiles between two of black's tiles. When black places 
 a tile on the board all of white's tiles between black's newly placed 
 tile and another black tile, in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, are flipped over 
 and become black, as shown in <xref linkend="first-shot"/>.

 </figure>

 <para>
 When there is tile trapped between two tiles, of an identical color 
 in the same row, the player captures tiles until another tile of the 
 player's color is encountered, as shown in <xref linkend="block-shot"/>.  
 The player can only take tiles that are 
 a direct result of the placing a tile on the board. Once a tile is 
 placed on the board the player cannot remove it and place the tile 
 somewhere else. If a player cannot move they forfeit their turn.  
 The game ends when it is no longer possible for either player to move.

 <figure id="block-shot">
  <title>White cannot capture the black tile in the center of the
  middle column because there are white tiles blocking the ends of that
  column. If it where blacks turn instead, black could place a tile at
  the top of the column but would only flip the first of the two white
  tiles.</title>

  <title>Player Color and Difficulty</title>
 
  <para>
  When you start Iagno the human player plays black and the computer player 
  plays white with the first level of difficulty. Using the
  <guimenuitem>Players</guimenuitem> tab in the
  <guisubmenu>Preferences</guisubmenu> dialog you can set the type of
  player for each color. Human is of course you, level one is the
  easiest computer player and level three is the hardest. You can set
  both to human to play against a friend or set both to computer to
  watch the computer play itself.
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="quick-moves">
  <title>Quick Moves Option</title>

  <para>
  This option is in the <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu. Then go to the 
  <guisubmenu>Preferences</guisubmenu> submenu in the <guimenuitem>Players
  </guimenuitem> tab and it is initially off. When enabled this option 
  makes the computer player place its tiles faster. 
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Note:</title>
   <para>
   Enabling this option does not force the computer player to move and does 
   not reduce the level of difficulty.

 menus with the <guimenuitem>Appearance</guimenuitem> tab highlighted.

 <sect2 id="animation-amount">
  <title>Animation</title>

  <para>
  This option controls the amount of animation present when each tile is 
  flipped, using radio buttons.  Selecting the option <guibutton>none
  </guibutton> will cause the tiles to change color instantaneously.  
  Selecting the <guibutton>option</guibutton> partial will cause the 
  animation to flip the tiles slowly.  Selecting the <guibutton>complete
  </guibutton> option will cause the tiles to flip slowly and smoothly.
  </para>

 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="stagger-flips">
  <title>Stagger Flips</title>
  
  <para>
  This option causes captured tiles along a row, column, or diagonal to
  flip one after another, like dominoes, instead of all flipping
  simultaneously.  It has no effect on game play, but looks cool.
  </para>

 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="grid">
  <title>Show Grid</title>

  <para>
  This option will display a grid on top of the playing surface.  The 
  grid is useful to display because it shows the player exactly where 
  they are placing each tile.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <title>Tip:</title>
   <para>
   This option should be enabled for beginning players to see the gameplay 
   more clearly.
   </para>

 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="flip-final">
  <title>Flip Final Results</title>

  <para>
  This option moves all the black tiles to the top of the board and all the 
  white tiles to the bottom of the board at the end of the game.  This allows 
  you to visually see the outcome of the game.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Note:</title>
   <para>
   This option does not affect the outcome of the game in any way.
   </para>
  </note>

 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="tile-set">
  <title>Tile Set</title>
  <para>
  This option lets you choose the type of board and tiles which are displayed.  
  If you want to make your own tile sets use the classic tile set as a template 
  and change the texture and colors for different effects.  When you make a new 
  tile set that works with Iagno send it to Ian Peters <email>itp@gnu.org</email> 
  and he will include it with the next distribution.
  </para>

  <important>
   <title>Important:</title>
   <para>
   There are three tile sets which look the same, but have different
   animations -- woodtrim, shrink, and blend.
   </para>
