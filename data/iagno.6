.SH DESCRIPTION
Iagno is a two\-player strategy game similar to Go.  The board is 8 by
8 with tiles that are black on one side and white on the other side.
The object of Iagno is to flip as  many of your opponent's tiles to
your color as possible without your opponent flipping your tiles.
This is done by trapping your opponent's tiles between two tiles of
your own color.
