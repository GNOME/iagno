.SH NAME
Reversi \- A disk flipping strategy board game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iagno
.RI [ OPTION... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reversi is a two-player strategy game, played on an 8 by 8 board.
Players use tiles that are dark on one side and light on the other.

The object of reversi is to flip your opponent’s tiles to your color,
while your opponent is trying to flip your tiles to his own color.
Opponent’s tiles are flipped when trapped between an already placed tile
of your color and the tile you add. Who finishes with more tiles wins!

Reversi allows you to play both a classic reversi game, and the
reversed variant, where the goal is to finish with less tiles than your
opponent.
